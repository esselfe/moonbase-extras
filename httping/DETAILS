cat << EOF
Httping is like 'ping' but for http-requests.
Give it an url, and it'll show you how long it takes to connect, send a request
and retrieve the reply (only the headers). Be aware that the transmission
across the network also takes time! So it measures the latency of the
webserver + network.
