WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes
state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and
more useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to
be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a
general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers
alike, fit for many different circumstances. Initially released for the Linux
kernel, it is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely
deployable. It is currently under heavy development, but already it might be
regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in
the industry.
