cat << EOF
r2 is a complete rewrite of radare. It provides a set of libraries, tools and
plugins to ease reverse engineering tasks. Distributed mostly under LGPLv3,
each plugin can have different licenses (see r2 -L, rasm2 -L, ...).

The radare project started as a simple command-line hexadecimal editor focused
on forensics. Today, r2 is a featureful low-level command-line tool with
support for scripting with the embedded Javascript interpreter or via r2pipe.

r2 can edit files on local hard drives, view kernel memory, and debug programs
locally or via a remote gdb/windbg servers. r2's wide architecture support
allows you to analyze, emulate, debug, modify, and disassemble any binary.
